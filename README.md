Qas
===

Qas is an acronym for Questions &amp; Answers Source.

A JavaScript Library build with AngularJS to recieve and view Questions from different sources
dependend on tagged content.

Using Qas provides a very easy way to put in a handful of different taggs
and in return get fitting Questions from differnt sources back.
